# Dashboard

This guide contains important instructions on how to use and develop the Synapse dashboard.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed [conda](https://docs.conda.io/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).

## How to generate the conda environment lock file

A new conda environment lock file can be generated by running the following commands:

```bash
conda activate base
conda install -c conda-forge conda-lock  # if conda-lock is not installed
conda-lock --file environment.yml --lockfile environment-lock.yml
```

## How to create the conda environment

The conda environment defined in the lock file can be created by running the following commands:

```bash
conda activate base
conda install -c conda-forge conda-lock  # if conda-lock is not installed
conda-lock install --name synapse-gui environment-lock.yml
```

## How to run the dashboard

1. Activate the conda environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate synapse-gui
    ```

2. Set the database settings (read-only):
    ```bash
    export SF_DB_HOST='127.0.0.1'
    export SF_DB_READONLY_PASSWORD='your_password_here'  # Use SINGLE quotes around the password!
    ```

3. Open a separate terminal and keep it open while SSH forwarding the database connection:
    ```bash
    ssh -L 27017:mongodb05.nersc.gov:27017 <username>@dtn03.nersc.gov -N
    ```

4. Run the dashboard from the `dashboard/` folder:
    - Via the web browser interface:
    ```bash
    python -u app.py --port 8080
    ```
    - As a desktop application:
    ```bash
    python -u app.py --app
    ```
    If you run the dashboard as a desktop application, make sure to set the following environment variable first:
    ```bash
    python -m pip install pywebview[qt]
    export PYWEBVIEW_GUI=qt
    ```

5. Terminate the application via `Ctrl` + `C`.

## How to build and run the Docker container

1. Move to the root directory of the repository.

2. Build the Docker image based on `Dockerfile`:
    ```bash
    docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t synapse-gui -f dashboard.Dockerfile .
    ```

3. Run the Docker container:
    ```bash
    docker run --network=host -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime -v $PWD/ml:/app/ml -e SF_DB_HOST='127.0.0.1' -e SF_DB_READONLY_PASSWORD='your_password_here' synapse-gui
    ```
    For debugging, you can also enter the container without starting the app:
    ```bash
    docker run --network=host -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime -v $PWD/ml:/app/ml -e SF_DB_HOST='127.0.0.1' -e SF_DB_READONLY_PASSWORD='your_password_here' -it synapse-gui bash
    ```
    Note that `-v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime` is necessary to synchronize the time zone in the container with the host machine.

4. (Optional) Publish the container privately to [NERSC registry](https://registry.nersc.gov):
    ```bash
    docker login registry.nersc.gov
    # Username: your NERSC username
    # Password: your NERSC password without 2FA
    ```
    ```bash
    docker tag synapse-gui:latest registry.nersc.gov/m558/superfacility/synapse-gui:latest
    docker tag synapse-gui:latest registry.nersc.gov/m558/superfacility/synapse-gui:$(date "+%y.%m")
    docker push -a registry.nersc.gov/m558/superfacility/synapse-gui
    ```
    This has been also automated through the Python script [publish_container.py](../publish_container.py), which can be executed via
    ```bash
    python publish_container.py --gui
    ```

5. (Optional) As you develop the container, you might want to prune old, unused images periodically in order to free space on your development machine:
    ```bash
    docker system prune -a
    ```

## How to get the Superfacility API credentials

Following the instructions at [docs.nersc.gov/services/sfapi/authentication/#client](https://docs.nersc.gov/services/sfapi/authentication/#client):

1. Log in to your profile page at [iris.nersc.gov/profile](https://iris.nersc.gov/profile).

2. Click the icon with your username in the upper right of the profile page.

3. Scroll down to the section "Superfacility API Clients" and click "New Client".

4. Enter a client name (e.g., "Synapse"), choose `sf558` for the user, choose "Red" security level, and select either "Your IP" or "Spin" from the "IP Presets" menu, depending on whether the key will be used from a local computer or from Spin.

5. Download the private key file (in pem format) and save it as `priv_key.pem` in the root directory of the dashboard.
   Each time the dashboard is launched, it will automatically find the existing key file and load the corresponding credentials.

6. Copy your client ID and add it on the first line of your private key file as described in the instructions at [nersc.github.io/sfapi_client/quickstart/#storing-keys-in-files](https://nersc.github.io/sfapi_client/quickstart/#storing-keys-in-files):
    ```
    randmstrgz
    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    ...
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    ```

7. Run `chmod 600 priv_key.pem` to change the permissions of your private key file to read/write only.
