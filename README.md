FY24/25 LDRD: IFE Superfacility
===============================

This is the project management for our FY24/25 LDRD on creating a blueprint for an IFE superfacility, that can combine experimental and simulation data through ML modeling with the goal to predict good experimental input parameters to achieve a certain goal (e.g., maximize number of particles produced in a certain energy range).

LDRD-funded partners: ATAP AMP (lead), ATAP BELLA (experiments), AMCRD (ML)

Self-funded partners: NERSC, SLAC
